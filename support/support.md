## Frequently Asked Questions

### 🎬 What is Movie Matchup?
Movie Matchup helps groups decide what to watch together. Create a session, invite friends with a code, swipe on movies, and get a group-approved pick — fast and fairly.

---

### 👥 Do I need an account?
No.  
Movie Matchup is completely **anonymous**. No sign-ups, profiles, or logins are required.

---

### 🔑 How do I join a session?
1. Open Movie Matchup
2. Enter the session code shared by the host
3. Join before the swiping phase begins

Once swiping starts, new users can’t join that session.

---

### 🤔 How is the winning movie chosen?
Each person swipes left or right on movies.  
Movie Matchup uses a **consensus-weighted algorithm** to find the movie the group agrees on most.

If everyone likes the same movie, the session can end early.

---

### 🔒 Is my data saved?
No.  
All sessions are **ephemeral**. Nothing is stored once the session ends.

---

### ❗ The app isn’t working — what should I do?
Try the following:
- Make sure everyone is on the latest version of the app
- Check your internet connection
- Restart the app and rejoin the session

If the issue persists, please contact support.
